# The Saxpad™
This is the repo for my Saxpad™, a test project to learn a bit before commiting to the R.A.P. It was my first time to ever do something like this, and took me a long time, but I'm proud of it.
It is a shortcut pad with a bare-bones design to show off all the (very cool) internals.

**INTERNALS:**
My Hackpad features a 3d printed case for the PCB that houses a XIAO-RP2040-DIP for the microcontroller, MX-Style switches for the keyboard switches, a rotary encoder switch for adjusting things with a knob, and some SK6812MINI LEDs as the backlit RGB.
